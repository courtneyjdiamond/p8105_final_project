## Exploring Citibikes 

[Citibike](exploratory/Citibike_exploratory.html)

## Exploring Subsets

[Air Quality index](exploratory/AirQual_exploratory.html)

[Social deprivation Index](exploratory/SDI_Exploratory.html)

[Overweight Trends](exploratory/Weight_exploratory.html) 

And we made an interactive [dashboard](Dashboard_Shiny.html) to visualize some of these exploratory analyses all together!

# <span style='color: blue;'>Modeling Outcomes</span>

We sought to develop linear models that would characterize the number of rides per station as a surrogate for utilization of citibikes. Predictors included Air quality measures, social deprivation index, and percentage of overweight individuals in a neighborhood. 

We then flipped these models and looked at the outcomes of these metrics, based on the other metrics and citibike utilization.
