## <span style="color: blue;">Motivation for our Project</span>
Increasing transportation costs, congested streets, and subway delays across New York City are pressuring residents to find cheaper and faster means of navigating the Big Apple. The introduction of [Citibike](https://citibikenyc.com/) has had an impact in increasing access to biking as an alternative means of transportation. Biking also has the added benefit of promoting health! However, do all NYers have equal access to these bikes and to the health benefits biking confers.

We, as public health students commuting to work and school in NYC, want to know if turning to CitiBike is a viable and equitable transportation alternative. We want to explore:

  * Where and when citibikes are used throughout NYC?
  * Who are these users? 
  * Is there disproportionate availability of CitiBikes across neighborhoods, specifically in neighborhoods with higher social deprivation?
  * Does disproportionate access exacerbate disparities in NYers health? 

To that end, we will explore CitiBike usage, aiming to understand usage patterns related to location within NYC, and its relation to social deprivation index, air quality, and health outcomes.
